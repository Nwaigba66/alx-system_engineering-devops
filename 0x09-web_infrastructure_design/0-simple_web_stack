- Server is a hardware or software that performs a specific task.

- The domain name identifies the IP address into human readable text.

- It is a commercial site with top level domain .com
- Role of web server:  manages the static content. Provides clients with the webpage (fron end)
- Role of app server: manages the dynamic content of the web page like the backend database and the code that acts on database. ( it might not interact with a database)

- Role of Database: holds data in question
- The server  usese http to communicate with clients ???
- SPOF: ( single point of failure) in this web infrastructure many factors can be raised that create failure like
    - absence of load balancers working as a cluster
    - absence of replicata nodes that hold replicated Mysql server
    - absence of monitoring tool that constantly checks servers for diffrent factors.

- The downtime needed to maintain the systme in case of failure. is to much
- Since we dont have load balancer it is impossible to scale app our servers. ( if not done will create bottle neck where many clints access a single server)
