- we are adding another server to the distributeion algorithm used by our load balancer is  round robbin:  where the servers are queued one after the other. 
the load balancer assigns connection to each server on the queue. If the last server on the queue is reached then it will start over from the beginning.

- our load balancer has an Active-Active setup to help it avoid problem if one of the servers fail

- in case of Active-Passive setup all the servers are not active all together increasing the latency time to start another server in case of failure.

- The primary replica of a cluster works in such a way that it decreases the load of reading data from the database by the master database.

- primary node holds the master database, while the replica holds the Replicat database together with web server and app server.

- The SPOF ( single point of failure) on the web infrastracture resides on the Load balances, since we have only one Load balancer where failure of it will
 result on failure of the whole web infrastructure.

- security issue:  we have no firewall and we are using http  so the infrastructure is not secured, hackers can easily access the server.

- no monitoring tool is implemented:  so resolving connection problems and providing data timely to clients is in question.
